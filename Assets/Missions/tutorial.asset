  msgs:
  - text: Welcome, soldier. This is a training simulation. Your job is to locate
      and neutralize a target building based only on descriptions (Press enter to
      continue)
  - text: You are not guessing. You are matching what you see in the city to what
      you hear from your commander
  - text: 'Look around with the drone camera and study the buildings: their height,
      width, shape and position in the city'
  - text: The commander will describe the target using features like heigjt and possition,
      it will be shown in the bottom left.
  - text: "Use the compass bar at the top to understand which direction you\u2019re
      looking (N, E, S, W). This helps you talk about buildings."
  - text: "Use the description to eliminate wrong buildings. If a building doesn\u2019t
      match the height, shape or location \u2013 ignore it."
  - text: Use WASD to control the drone.
  - text: "When you\u2019re ready, follow the commander\u2019s description and try
      to find the training target building."
