  - text: "Good work out there, soldier. You stayed disciplined, confirmed your target,
      and didn\u2019t bite on decoys. "
  - text: "Now you\u2019re moving to the final mission\u2014identifiers will be tighter,
      lookalikes will be deliberate, and you\u2019ll get less margin for error. Same
      rule as always: you\u2019re not guessing. Match the description exactly, confirm,
      then act."
  - text: Good luck.
