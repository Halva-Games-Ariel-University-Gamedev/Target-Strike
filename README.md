## Play test questions

1. Do the drone black & white and static filters add to the game or should they be removed ?
2. Are the maps too big / too small / just right for the game progression ?
3. Does the drone sway and tilt when moving cause disorientation / annoyance ?
4. Should the drone be able to fly up / down or is the constant height better ? 
5. Are the curremt puzzles too hard / easy ?
6. Does the game explain the control in a good way ?
